<!-- Known Quaternions for the right arm: -->
<!-- (0,1,0,0) and (0,-1,0,0) is down, with palm facing inwards -->
<!-- (1,0,0,0) and (-1,,0,0,0) is down, with palm facing outwards -->
<!-- (0.70710678118, 0.70710678118, 0, 0)/(1,1,0,0) is down, with palm facing forwards-->
<!-- (-1, 1, 0, 0) is down, with palm facing backwards -->
<!-- (-1, 0, 1, 0) is to the robot's right, palm facing upwards -->
<!-- (1, -1, 1, 1) is forward, palm down -->
<!-- (2,1,0,0) is down, with palm facing towards the robot's 1 o'clock approximately -->
<!-- (1,2,0,0) is down, with palm facing 11 o'clock -->
<!-- (2,0,1,0) is down/inwards, with palm facing down/outwards -->
<!-- (-2,0,1,0) is down/outwards, with palm facing up/outwards -->
<!-- (1.5,-1,1,1) is forward/slightly downwards, with palm facing downwards -->
<!-- (1.5,-1,1.5,1) is pointing to the robot's 11 o'clock, with palm facing downwards -->
<!-- (1.5,-1,1.5,1.5) is pointing to the robot's 11 o'clock, slightly upwards. Palm is downwards -->
<!-- (1.5,-1.5,1.5,1) is pointing to the robot's 11 o'clock, slightly downwards. Palm downwards -->
<!-- (2,-2,2,1) is pointing to the robot's 11 o'clock, slightly downwards. Palm is downwards, with a slight roll towards the robot's torso-->
<!-- (3,-3,3,1) is pointing same direction as (2,-2,2,1) with more roll about the horizontal axis pointing in front of the robot -->
<!-- (3,-2.5,2.5,1) is pointing at 10 o'clock, with same characteristics as (2,-2,2,1)-->
<!-- (3,-2.5,2,1) is pointing similar to above, except more downwards-->
<!-- (3,-1,2.5,1) is pointing to almost 9 o'clock, almost horizontally -->

<!-- (3,-2,2,1) is pointing to the front of the robot, towards a target on a table -->
<!-- For the left arm, the equivalent orientation is (-3,-2,2,-1) -->

<!-- Good test position is (+-0.1, -0.2, 0.83) -->
