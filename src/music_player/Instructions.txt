Instructions:

The package music player contains three important files:
1) music_player.cpp
2) music_player_client.cpp
3) audio_player.cpp

The music_player is for the action server for playing background music and celebration music.
The music_player_client is the action client for playing background music.

Both of the above have been integrated into the bingo game already.

The audio_player is a helper class (NOT an action library) for playing mp3 audio clips. It's based on music_player.

Once you initialize an instance of audio_player, just call play_file( ... ) to play a file.

Ex.
	music_player::audioPlayer player;
	player.play_file(filePath);

The function play_file is blocking.
