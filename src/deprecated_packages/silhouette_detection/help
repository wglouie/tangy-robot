(Note: use the openni camera that DOES NOT say "doesn't work")

Steps to make tangy follow people:
1. Make sure tangy's base is turned on. Open a new terminal. Type in the following: 		roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
2. Open a new terminal. Type in  the following: 	sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
3. Turn base one. Type in the following: 		roslaunch tangerine_2dnav my_robot_configuration.launch
4. Open a new terminal. Type in the following: 		roslaunch tangerine_2dnav move_base.launch
5. Open a new terminal. Type in the following:		cd ~/tangy-robot
6. Type in the following:				rosrun silhouette_detection silhouette_detection
7. Open a new terminal. Type in the following:		rosrun silhouette_detection sil_subscriber

Steps to create a new svm_map (the green and blue blobs):
1. Open a new terminal. Type in the following:		roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
2. Open a new terminal. Type in the following:		cd ~/tangy-robot
3. Open a new terminal. Type in the following:		rosrun silhouette_detection silhouette_capture_ros.cpp
4. Follow the instruction onscreen to create your SVM map.
5. E-mail me at ervin.ibadula@gmail.com with svm_data.csv attached so that I can calculate it, tangy's silhouette_svm executable doesn't work because it is using the wrong version of opencv.
6. I'll send back a new file that will be read by silhouette_detection
