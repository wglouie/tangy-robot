1) Check if servers have been connected to:
8) Move back to original position? (Jacob's stuff has it rotate completely to turn around (180 degrees), then move to position, then rotate back to look forward (0 degrees)
9) After end task we should at least take one more action before finishing
11) Help is engaging even though it isn't in front of the right person. Must be fixed
12) Learn to sense
13) Added triangle detection overlaid on rgb image for help_indicators package
14) Created a script for installing OPENNI NITE 
15) Added packages for openni_tracker and skeleton markers

*10) Valediction should not have movement
*28) Show all positions that need help on gui
*19) End task learning
*13) Create appropriate activity states;
*31) Undo state-action pair
*32) Create a semi-autonomous system for now
*33) World_state_ID client is different state at the beginning the world state server. Call service and update world state during intialization from now on 
*21) Fix bug where I have to manually start help indicators from the topic
*29) Set robot initial pose when laoding world state
*7) Backup when doing gestures near the table (i.e. Performing help)
*30) Cleaned up all unused redundant code in help_indicators (Commented out only for now)
*16) Make World State Identifier remember last state when continuing game. Publish state immediately 	
*26) Force start tangy in particular state  or save state of the game to continue after
*14) Action learner should record when help starts and ends;
*20) Show images of Bingo Card and Help in world state identifier
*22) Starting new game should mean new trajecotry created for activity learner. Call service
*22) detection images now published to help_indicators/detected_triangles
*23) States-Action pairs are out of order. States are behind by one time step
*24) Note help phase when recording trajectory
*29) Have buttons to skip speech
*25) When card is not being detected in world_state_identifier make the card_state occluded
*27) Tangy is currently incorrectly saying that there is no assistance required after it has moved to the user
*21) Turn off gestures to speed up learning
*22) We need a state where the robot is at the requesters position
*17) Make red signal when things are in progress
*12) Start new game with new numbers button
*3) remove_marker, request_to_show_bingo_card, mark_numbers, congratulations, encourage should all have the robot not move when performing the action and back away to protect the robot from hitting the table
*9) Robot needs to move his head down when detecting a card
*10) People need to be able to dump triangles that have been completed
*11) Ensure when user is being helped the demonstrator must complete help before moving onto next person
*6) Clear help triangle after completing help
*5) Publish world_state and action info to the remote computer (GUI) so we know what is going on 
*2) GUI should not let goals be sent when a goal is active for world_state_identifier or action_executor
*4) GUI needs to have flipping widget screens
*6) If robot is already in position don't do anything
*7) We have a 40cm goal tolerence for navigation
