- You can now customize actions in action executor by providing gesture file names (the base name so you don't need left or right)
- You can also save the database xml for the actions in an xml file
- Both the aforementioned work using action_execution subscribers so you just need to publish to the topics the necessary messages.
- Custom gestures now replace default gestures during the interaction
- Task Learning package makes new save directory named ".../action_executor/database/custom_actions/save[X]" for saving customized gestures and speech for the actions
- When Bingo game finishes the customized action database is saved in ".../action_executor/database/custom_actions/save[X]/actions.xml" by the Task Learning package
- Creating gesture directory is now done by action_executor service because we want the computer that processes this node to contain the directory. It is no longer required by the rqt_task_learning package.
